# Hourly Bell Tower

*Time flows forward and the speed of time does not change for individuals.*

Hourly Bell Tower reminds users that time is always moving forward. A bell will ring every hour every day, starting the userâ€™s day with a set first bell and ending the day with the last bell.

This application is for those that want an hourly reminder of the time without having to think about repeatedly setting and shutting off an alarm.

## Inspiration

This idea is based on bell towers used in the past, during the times when clock/bell towers were used to inform communities/towns the hourly time.
